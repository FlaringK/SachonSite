<h1>RULES</h1>

<p>
  These rules apply to the Discord, VRChat server, and panels! <br>
</p>

<p>
  1) Be courteous and respectful to everyone. This includes no harassment, argument/discourse, spamming, ignoring mods, and posting NSFW/harmful imagery in chat. One warning will be issued, then you will be kicked. This rule also applies to third party chat rooms if panelists report issues. <br>
</p>

<p>
  2) Please report conflict to the moderators. Do not participate in arguments/discourse. Homestuck 2 &amp; post-canon topics should remain civil. <br>
</p>

<p>
  3) Slurs, purposeful spamming, and discriminatory comments/jokes/imagery/hate speech (racism, anti semitism, ableism, transphobia, anti-lgbt, islamophobia) are not allowed. These will not be tolerated, and mods reserve the right to remove these posts, mute, kick, or ban on sight. <br>
</p>

<p>
  4) If you need a mod, @ #❓help-desk . If you need to DM a mod, please ask the help desk who is available. <br>
</p>

<p>
  5) Please do not advertise servers, commissions, or any other content unaffiliated with SAHCon! <br>
</p>

<p>
  6) Do not single out or dogpile individual panelists, guests, artists, or attendees. <br>
</p>

<p>
  7) Please do not swap personal information with other attendees. <br>
</p>

<p>
  8) No NSFW conversations or content in this server! Conversations should be PG-13+. Swearing is not considered inherently NSFW, but sexually explicit language and slurs aren’t allowed. <br>
</p>

<p>
  9) Keep sensitive topics at a minimum, such as politics and pandemic-based conversation. Real life tragedies should not be discussed. <br>

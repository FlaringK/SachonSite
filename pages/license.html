<h1>SAHCON HAS BECOME OFFICALLY LICENSED</h1>

<p>
  We've partnered with the HICU and Homestuck, Inc. to become the first officially licensed Homestuck convention! We're really excited about what this means for the future!
</p>

<h3>
  What DOES this mean?
</h3>

<p>
  It means working with the folks at the HICU to come up with new ideas for fun stuff to do with SAHCon! As well as new opportunities to promote and expand the con!
</p>

<h3>
  Is SAHCon changing hands?
</h3>

<p>
  SAHCon's staff isn't changing, and we'll be running things basically the same! We'll still be doing the con online, along with our Winter/New Years and Friday showcases!
</p>

<p>
  Thanks to everyone involved in the Con over the years - none of this would've happened without the hard work of our directors, moderators, artists, guests, and panelists, and all of you for coming out to support us!
</p>

<p>
  The future is bright, and we're glad you're here for it!

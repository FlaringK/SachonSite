<h1>CONVENTION ACTIVITIES</h1>

<p>
  During the con, we will be having panels and our artist alley. However, there will be other events taking place that are brought to you by the con itself!
</p>

<p>
  Lots of these activities have their engagement take place in the Discord server during the day of the convention, but we have a couple that will be accessible outside of it!

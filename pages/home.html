<h2>ABOUT SAHCON</h2>

<p>
  Stuck at Home Con (affectionately abbreviated to SAHCon) is an online Homestuck fan convention that started its run in 2019. Fans of Homestuck, Hiveswap, Problem Sleuth, and other MSPA-related properties gather to spend the Saturday engaging over these shared interests! <br>
</p>

<p>
  Our goal is: <br>
  <ol>
    <li>To host an alternative for those who cannot experience the likes of a physical con due to circumstance.</li>
    <li>To celebrate fandom creativity and encourage a positive, supportive community!</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  During the day the convention features streamed fan panels, an Artist Alley line up, and a large discord server for chatting with other fans! The convention also has many other activities such as our late night rave, art raffle, live drawing board, and our VRChat server! You can explore the website links to see all of whatâ€™s in store! <br>
